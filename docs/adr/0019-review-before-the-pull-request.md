# 0019. Review runs on the branch, and opening a pull request is handing it over

Status: Accepted; amended by `docs/adr/0020-two-reviews-and-an-inline-act.md`, which removes the
block review this ADR placed on the branch and the mandate its decision 5 restored. Then by
`docs/adr/0028-the-budget-follows-the-ecosystem.md`, decision 6: the holistic review no longer runs
on the branch but on `main` at the head of Wrap, so decision 1 keeps the gate alone, and the
commit-range pinning of decision 4 and of decision 5's second half has nothing left to pin, the
lot's blocks being all merged when the review reads them. Decisions 2 and 3 stand as written
Date: 2026-09-04
Amends: `docs/adr/0018-a-block-is-a-pull-request.md`, decision 8, on where the block and holistic
reviews run and on two of its cuts to the block mandate. Everything else in that ADR stands,
decisions 1 to 7 included.

## Context

ADR 0018 decision 8 places both reviews on a pull request: the block review "on each block's pull
request, before the operator reads it", the holistic review "on the last block's pull request,
before it merges". `agents/workflow.md` phase 4 spelled that out as opening the pull request first
so continuous integration runs while the reviewers read, and closed the paragraph with "Nothing is
offered to the user yet."

That sentence is false, and the operator demonstrated it on the lot that introduced it: pull request
#74 was merged while its block review and its holistic review were still running.

**There is no state in which a pull request is open and the user has not been offered it.** It is in
their list, it notifies them, and they can merge it. An open pull request is the offer. A review
still reading while one is open is a review whose findings can arrive after the merge, which is the
exact failure mode series was adopted to remove: ADR 0018 decision 2 exists so that nothing is built
on unreviewed work, and opening early reintroduces it one level up, at the merge instead of at the
next block.

The placement came from closing a block review finding on ADR 0018's own branch. That finding said
three statements in the mandates assumed a pull request that phase 4 had not yet created, and it
offered two repairs: open the pull request earlier, or point the mandates at the local gate. The
first was taken. It was the wrong one, and it traded a documentation inconsistency for a process
defect.

## Decision

1. **Verify runs entirely on the local branch, and no pull request exists during it.** The gate, the
   block review, the holistic review where it applies, and the closing of their findings all happen
   before anything is pushed for integration.

2. **Opening a pull request is the act of handing it over**, so it belongs to Integrate, and it
   **opens as a draft**. Waiting for continuous integration behind a non-draft pull request would
   delay the message and not the merge, `enforce_admins` being false; GitHub refusing a merge on a
   draft is what actually holds it. The run settles, the pull request is marked ready, and the link
   goes to the operator with the result named.

3. **A red run, or a change the human asks for, returns the block to Verify.** Back to draft, commit
   the fix, re-run the gate, re-run the block review over the new commits only. A merge never rests
   on a review that did not read what is being merged. Without this the regime removes "the merge
   precedes the review" at the start of Integrate and lets it back in at the end.

4. **The mandates read a branch, not a pull request**, and each names *this block's* pull request
   rather than any, since earlier blocks of the same lot have theirs already. Both are pinned to a
   fixed commit range rather than to `HEAD`, which moves under a reviewer while its own findings are
   being closed.

5. **Two of ADR 0018 decision 8's cuts to the block mandate are reversed.** Branch coverage returns,
   scoped: the gate enforces it only inside the perimeter, and `api-application` and the Ebean model
   packages are outside it (`agents/engineering.md`), so a new conditional there is the reviewer's.
   And the pinning to a named commit range returns outright: 0018 dropped it on the premise that in
   series nothing is in flight, and that premise was falsified inside 0018's own lot, whose block
   merged mid-review while a follow-on branch edited the files under review. `agents/reviews/holistic.md`
   criterion 6 carried the same coverage premise and is scoped the same way.

## Block table

One block, `fix/review-before-the-pull-request`: `agents/workflow.md` phases 2, 4, 5 and the review
tables, `agents/reviews/block.md`, `agents/reviews/holistic.md`, `agents/writing.md`, this ADR, ADR
0018's `Status`, and the backlog items below. It satisfies every decision above.

**Third angle: none, and the reason.** The three spec angles did not run on this document. It records
a correction the operator specified in one sentence and proposes nothing they have not already
decided, and its only factual claims (the PR #74 timings, the continuous integration medians) were
measured inside this lot with the commands shown in the commit messages. The block review and the
holistic review both ran and are what this ADR was corrected against. Named here so it is a stated
exception rather than a silent one.

**Adjacent backlog items.** One is adjacent: "Measure what review costs and what it returns". It
stays open. This lot changes where reviews run, not what they cost, and the measurement needs
session transcripts that no command in this repository reads.

## Consequences

- **Continuous integration no longer overlaps the reviews.** That was the whole benefit of the
  earlier placement and it is given up. The cost is about seven minutes of wall clock per block, on
  the median of the twelve most recent runs, and it buys back the guarantee that a merge cannot
  precede a review.
- **A review that finds nothing still delays the pull request.** The reviews are the last thing
  between a green gate and the operator's inbox, so their latency is now on the critical path of
  every block. If that becomes the friction the operator reports, the answer is fewer or faster
  reviews, not an earlier pull request.
- **Continuous integration no longer has a head start, so Integrate has to wait for it.** Under the
  old order the run finished while the reviews read. Under this one it starts when the pull request
  opens, and handing over a link with a pending run would move "the merge precedes the evidence"
  from the reviews onto continuous integration rather than removing it. That already happened:
  PR #74's `validate / gate` reported success 4 minutes 45 after the merge, `enforce_admins` being
  false. `agents/workflow.md` phase 5 therefore waits for the run to settle before the link is
  handed over.
- **The checks no local command reproduces now run after the block review, not beside it**: the
  container image build, its smoke test, and the `docs/openapi.json` sync. A failure in any of them
  produces a fix commit that no block review has read. Both mandates say so rather than implying
  continuous integration merely repeats the gate.

## Findings filed

ADR 0018's own lot ran under the defective order, and its two reviews reported after their pull
request had merged. That lot's Wrap is closed and its handoff is frozen, so this is the only place
left to record where its findings went. All of them are open work; none was refused.

- **Block review of `d644257f`** (one CRITICAL, five MAJOR, six MINOR), on the backlog compression:
  the `renewLease` item lost the two sentences saying why the work matters, which exist nowhere else,
  and points at a section arguing the fix was dropped; the first item's pointer names the wrong bullet
  of the right document and credits it with an entity list it does not carry; the item marked
  "reasoning is only here" is in fact carried by that same section; `agents/workflow.md` still states
  the two-line rule with the refuted premise; the "six of fourteen" figure is four; and six MINOR on
  pointer precision, a KDoc the rule does not admit, and a stale line count in `agents/writing.md`.
  Filed as one backlog item; no lot owns it yet.
- **Holistic review of the lot** (three CRITICAL, eight MAJOR, six MINOR), every one accounted for.
  **Four became their own backlog items**, being decisions rather than edits: decisions 4 and 5
  colliding on an over-budget block, the specification freezing before the regime stops changing it,
  a holistic finding against a merged block having no exit, and the lost ADR-existence check.
  **Three are filed as small corrections**: `AGENTS.md` on what no local command covers, the `P0`
  band neither file has, and the missing ADR back-links with ADR 0014 still `Proposed`.
  **Ten are closed in this block**: the review table timing both reviews against a pull request and
  contradicting the prose on a one-block lot; the branch-coverage premise, in both mandates; the
  silently dropped verification of red before green, which both now require again; the plurality
  `agents/reviews/holistic.md` assumed; the twelve-minute figure; Wrap's stale "reconciles on `main`";
  the two-line rule stated in `agents/workflow.md` without its exception; the holistic dispatched
  over a floating `HEAD`; the missing route back from a red run or a change request; and this lot
  running as tier Spec with no specification, which phase 2 now provides for.
